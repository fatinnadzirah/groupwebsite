			<h2><b>Food Donation Campaign </b></h2>
			<p style="color: black">99 SPEEDMART Food Bank established in March 2020.
				Lee Thiam Wah has launched this campaign to encourage
				those who want to do charity to participate in the monthly distribution
				of food to poverty, illness, single parents and old folks family.Some of people believe that they cannot live without  luxuries things and cutting-edge technology. 
				However there’s more important thing than that which are the meals that we eat each morning, lunch, and evening.   
				Speedmart's food donation campaign  aim to giving to those in need to make our neighbourhood or town a better place to live. 
				Giving food to deserving individuals or groups helps fight poverty and hunger while also fostering a sense of community, kindness, and
				trust among locals.</p>
